- At least 4 sprites / frames for players
- A small map with at least 10 levels
- Joystick / gamepad support. Unfortunately I don't have one to try it out.
  (Apparently there's a lot of limitations with keyboard for 2 player games,
  so joystick / gamepad support is essential to having a good experience for
  local multiplayer). This shouldn't affect Single player experience on
  keyboard.
