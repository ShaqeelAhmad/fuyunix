# fuyunix
A small platformer game using SDL2

# Dependencies
```
C compiler*
Cairo
SDL2_image
```
\* I have only tried with tcc, gcc and clang; I mostly use tcc and might forget
to test with gcc / clang.

# Portablility
I use Linux and can't guarantee that the program will work on other operating
systems

# Files
`src/` directory contains the source code
`man/` contains the man page
`data/` contains the assets

# Installation
```sh
make
make install
```

# Usage
-v for version
don't pass any arguments to start the game.

Vi keybindings by default because why not.
