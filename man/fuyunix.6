.SH DESCRIPTION
fuyunix is a platformer game with local multiplayer support.
.P
Most of the games now are online multiplayer games where you have to be
connected to the internet. I thought It'll be a good idea to create a game with
local multiplayer just to go against the norms.
.P
This game will still be playable with a single user because I don't have any
friends to play with. It will just support multiplayer on case someone wants
to play with their friend locally.
.SH NOTE
When I say multiplayer I mainly mean 2 players. There might be support
for more players but I can't confirm it.
.SH OPTIONS

.SH BUGS AND ISSUES
This game is still under development so there will be a lot of them.
